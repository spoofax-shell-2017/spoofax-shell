# The Eclipse plugin module cannot be build in the same reactor build, so it has
# to be build separately. This also means that its dependencies will not be
# automatically resolved, hence the `install` phase for the reactor build.
# To work around a bug in the Eclipse compiler, all modules have to be build
# separately.
